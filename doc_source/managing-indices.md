# Managing indices in Amazon OpenSearch Service<a name="managing-indices"></a>

After you add data to Amazon OpenSearch Service, you often need to reindex that data, work with index aliases, move an index to more cost\-effective storage, or delete it altogether\. This chapter covers UltraWarm storage, cold storage, and Index State Management\. For information on the OpenSearch index APIs, see the [OpenSearch documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/opensearch/reindex-data/)\.
