# Sizing Amazon ES Domains<a name="sizing-domains"></a>

No surefire method of sizing Amazon ES domains exists, but by starting with an understanding of your storage needs, the service, and Elasticsearch itself, you can make an educated initial estimate on your hardware needs\. This estimate can serve as a useful starting point for the most critical aspect of sizing domains: testing them with representative workloads and monitoring their performance\.

## Calculating Storage Requirements<a name="aes-bp-storage"></a>

Most Elasticsearch workloads fall into one of two broad categories:
+ Long\-lived index: You write code that processes data into one or more Elasticsearch indices and then updates those indices periodically as the source data changes\. Some common examples are website, document, and e\-commerce search\.
+ Rolling indices: Data continuously flows into a set of temporary indices, with an indexing period and retention window, such as a set of daily indices that is retained for two weeks\. Some common examples are log analytics, time\-series processing, and clickstream analytics\.

For long\-lived index workloads, you can examine the source data on disk and easily determine how much storage space it consumes\. If the data comes from multiple sources, just add those sources together\.

For rolling indices, you can multiply the amount of data generated during a representative time period by the retention period\. For example, if you generate 200 MB of log data per hour, that's 4\.8 GB per day, which is 67 GB of data at any given time if you have a two\-week retention period\.

The size of your source data, however, is just one aspect of your storage requirements\. You also have to consider the following:

1. Number of replicas: Each replica is a full copy of an index and needs the same amount of disk space\. By default, each Elasticsearch index has one replica\. We recommend at least one to prevent data loss\. Replicas also improve search performance, so you might want more if you have a read\-heavy workload\.

1. Elasticsearch indexing overhead: The on\-disk size of an index varies, but is often 10% larger than the source data\. After indexing your data, you can use the `_cat/indices` API and `pri.store.size` value to calculate the exact overhead\. The `_cat/allocation` API also provides a useful summary\.

1. Operating system reserved space: By default, Linux reserves 5% of the file system for the `root` user for critical processes, system recovery, and to safeguard against disk fragmentation problems\.

1. Amazon ES overhead: Amazon ES reserves 20% of the storage space of each instance \(up to 20 GB\) for segment merges, logs, and other internal operations\.

   Because of this 20 GB maximum, the total amount of reserved space can vary dramatically depending on the number of instances in your domain\. For example, a domain might have three `m4.xlarge.elasticsearch` instances, each with 500 GB of storage space, for a total of 1\.5 TB\. In this case, the total reserved space is only 60 GB\. Another domain might have 10 `m3.medium.elasticsearch` instances, each with 100 GB of storage space, for a total of 1 TB\. Here, the total reserved space is 200 GB, even though the first domain is 50% larger\.

   In the following formula, we apply a "worst\-case" estimate for overhead that is accurate for domains with less than 100 GB of storage space per instance and over\-allocates for larger instances\.

In summary, if you have 67 GB of data at any given time and want one replica, your *minimum* storage requirement is closer to 67 \* 2 \* 1\.1 / 0\.95 / 0\.8 = 194 GB\. You can generalize this calculation as follows:

**Source Data \* \(1 \+ Number of Replicas\) \* \(1 \+ Indexing Overhead\) / \(1 \- Linux Reserved Space\) / \(1 \- Amazon ES Overhead\) = Minimum Storage Requirement**

Or you can use this simplified version:

**Source Data \* \(1 \+ Number of Replicas\) \* 1\.45 = Minimum Storage Requirement**

Insufficient storage space is one of the most common causes of cluster instability, so you should cross\-check the numbers when you [choose instance types, instance counts, and storage volumes](#aes-bp-instances)\.

**Note**  
If your minimum storage requirement exceeds 1 PB, see [Petabyte Scale for Amazon Elasticsearch Service](petabyte-scale.md)\.

## Choosing the Number of Shards<a name="aes-bp-sharding"></a>

After you understand your storage requirements, you can investigate your indexing strategy\. Each Elasticsearch index is split into some number of shards\. Because you can't easily change the number of primary shards for an existing index, you should decide about shard count *before* indexing your first document\.

The overarching goal of choosing a number of shards is to distribute an index evenly across all data nodes in the cluster\. However, these shards shouldn't be too large or too numerous\. A good rule of thumb is to try to keep shard size between 10â€“50 GB\. Large shards can make it difficult for Elasticsearch to recover from failure, but because each shard uses some amount of CPU and memory, having too many small shards can cause performance issues and out of memory errors\. In other words, shards should be small enough that the underlying Amazon ES instance can handle them, but not so small that they place needless strain on the hardware\.

For example, suppose you have 67 GB of data\. You don't expect that number to increase over time, and you want to keep your shards around 30 GB each\. Your number of shards therefore should be approximately 67 \* 1\.1 / 30 = 3\. You can generalize this calculation as follows:

 **\(Source Data \+ Room to Grow\) \* \(1 \+ Indexing Overhead\) / Desired Shard Size = Approximate Number of Primary Shards**

This equation helps compensate for growth over time\. If you expect those same 67 GB of data to quadruple over the next year, the approximate number of shards is \(67 \+ 201\) \* 1\.1 / 30 = 10\. Remember, though, you don't have those extra 201 GB of data *yet*\. Check to make sure this preparation for the future doesn't create unnecessarily tiny shards that consume huge amounts of CPU and memory in the present\. In this case, 67 \* 1\.1 / 10 shards = 7\.4 GB per shard, which will consume extra resources and is below the recommended size range\. You might consider the more middle\-of\-the\-road approach of six shards, which leaves you with 12 GB shards today and 49 GB shards in the future\. Then again, you might prefer to start with three 30 GB shards and reindex your data when the shards exceed 50 GB\.

**Note**  
By default, Elasticsearch indices are split into five primary shards\. You can specify different settings when you [create an index](es-indexing.md#es-indexing-intro)\.

## Choosing Instance Types and Testing<a name="aes-bp-instances"></a>

After you calculate your storage requirements and choose the number of shards that you need, you can start to make hardware decisions\. Hardware requirements vary dramatically by workload, but we can still offer some basic recommendations\.

In general, [the storage limits](aes-limits.md) for each instance type map to the amount of CPU and memory you might need for light workloads\. For example, an `m4.large.elasticsearch` instance has a maximum EBS volume size of 512 GB, 2 vCPU cores, and 8 GB of memory\. If your cluster has many shards, performs taxing aggregations, updates documents frequently, or processes a large number of queries, those resources might be insufficient for your needs\. If you believe your cluster falls into one of these categories, try starting with a configuration closer to 2 vCPU cores and 8 GB of memory for every 100 GB of your storage requirement\.

**Tip**  
For a summary of the hardware resources that are allocated to each instance type, see [Amazon Elasticsearch Service Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/pricing/)\.

Still, even those resources might be insufficient\. Some Elasticsearch users report that they need many times those resources to fulfill their requirements\. Finding the right hardware for your workload means making an educated initial estimate, testing with representative workloads, adjusting, and testing again:

1. To start, we recommend a minimum of three instances to avoid potential Elasticsearch issues, such as the split brain issue\. If you have three [dedicated master nodes](es-managedomains-dedicatedmasternodes.md), we still recommend a minimum of two data nodes for replication\.

1. If you have a 184 GB storage requirement and the recommended minimum number of three instances, you use the equation 184 / 3 = 61 GB to find the amount of storage that each instance needs\. In this example, you might select three `m4.large.elasticsearch` instances for your cluster, each using a 90 GB EBS storage volume so that you have a safety net and some room for growth over time\. This configuration provides 6 vCPU cores and 24 GB of memory, so it's suited to lighter workloads\.

   For a more substantial example, consider a 14 TB storage requirement and a heavy workload\. In this case, you might choose to begin testing with 2 \* 140 = 280 vCPU cores and 8 \* 140 = 1120 GB of memory\. These numbers work out to approximately 18 `i3.4xlarge.elasticsearch` instances\. If you don't need the fast, local storage, you could also test 18 `r4.4xlarge.elasticsearch` instances, each using a 900 GB EBS storage volume\.

   If your cluster includes hundreds of terabytes of data, see [Petabyte Scale for Amazon Elasticsearch Service](petabyte-scale.md)\.

1. After configuring the cluster, you can [add your index](es-indexing.md), perform some representative client testing using a realistic dataset, and [monitor CloudWatch metrics](es-managedomains.md#es-managedomains-cloudwatchmetrics) to see how the cluster handles the workload\.

1. If performance satisfies your needs, tests succeed, and CloudWatch metrics are normal, the cluster is ready to use\. Remember to [set CloudWatch alarms](cloudwatch-alarms.md) to detect unhealthy resource usage\.

   If performance isn't acceptable, tests fail, or `CPUUtilization` or `JVMMemoryPressure` are high, you might need to choose a different instance type \(or add instances\) and continue testing\. As you add instances, Elasticsearch automatically rebalances the distribution of shards throughout the cluster\.

   Because it is easier to measure the excess capacity in an overpowered cluster than the deficit in an underpowered one, we recommend starting with a larger cluster than you think you need, testing, and scaling down to an efficient cluster that has the extra resources to ensure stable operations during periods of increased activity\.

Production clusters or clusters with complex states benefit from [dedicated master nodes](es-managedomains-dedicatedmasternodes.md), which improve performance and cluster reliability\.
