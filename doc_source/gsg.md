# Getting started with Amazon OpenSearch Service<a name="gsg"></a>

This tutorial shows you how to use Amazon OpenSearch Service to create and configure a test domain\. An OpenSearch Service domain is synonymous with an OpenSearch cluster\. Domains are clusters with the settings, instance types, instance counts, and storage resources that you specify\.

This tutorial walks you through the basic steps to get an OpenSearch Service domain up and running quickly\. For more detailed information, see [Creating and managing Amazon OpenSearch Service domains](createupdatedomains.md) and the other topics within this guide\. For information on migrating to OpenSearch Service from a self\-managed OpenSearch cluster, see [Migrating to Amazon OpenSearch Service](migration.md)\.

You can complete the following steps by using the OpenSearch Service console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDK:

1. [Create a domain](gsgcreate-domain.md)

1. [Upload data for indexing](gsgupload-data.md)

1. [Search documents](gsgsearch.md)
