# AWS managed policies for Amazon OpenSearch Service<a name="ac-managed"></a>

To add permissions to users, groups, and roles, it is easier to use AWS managed policies than to write policies yourself\. It takes time and expertise to [create IAM customer managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create-console.html) that provide your team with only the permissions they need\. To get started quickly, you can use our AWS managed policies\. These policies cover common use cases and are available in your AWS account\. For more information about AWS managed policies, see [AWS managed policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html#aws-managed-policies) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

AWS services maintain and update AWS managed policies\. You can't change the permissions in AWS managed policies\. Services occasionally add additional permissions to an AWS managed policy to support new features\. This type of update affects all identities \(users, groups, and roles\) where the policy is attached\. Services are most likely to update an AWS managed policy when a new feature is launched or when new operations become available\. Services do not remove permissions from an AWS managed policy, so policy updates won't break your existing permissions\.

Additionally, AWS supports managed policies for job functions that span multiple services\. For example, the **ViewOnlyAccess** AWS managed policy provides read\-only access to many AWS services and resources\. When a service launches a new feature, AWS adds read\-only permissions for new operations and resources\. For a list and descriptions of job function policies, see [AWS managed policies for job functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

****  

| Change | Description | Date | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  Updated `AmazonOpenSearchServiceCognitoAccess` and `AmazonESCognitoAccess`  |  Added support for the `UpdateUserPoolClient` action, which is required to set Cognito user pool configuration during upgrade from Elasticsearch to OpenSearch\. Corrected permissions for the `SetIdentityPoolRoles` action to allow access to all resources\. For the policy JSON, see the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonOpenSearchServiceCognitoAccess)\.  |  20 December 2021  | 
|  Updated `AmazonOpenSearchServiceRolePolicy`  |  Added support for the `security-group` resource type\. The policy provides the minimum Amazon EC2 and Elastic Load Balancing permissions necessary for [the service\-linked role](slr.md#slr-permissions) to enable [VPC access](cognito-auth.md)\. For the policy JSON, see the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonOpenSearchServiceRolePolicy)\.  |  9 September 2021  | 
|  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/ac-managed.html)  |  This new policy is meant to replace the old policy\. Both policies provide full access to the OpenSearch Service configuration API and all HTTP methods for the OpenSearch APIs\. [Fine\-grained access control](fgac.md) and [resource\-based policies](ac.md#ac-types-resource) can still restrict access\. For the policy JSON, see the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonOpenSearchServiceFullAccess)\.  |  7 September 2021  | 
|  [\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/ac-managed.html)  |  This new policy is meant to replace the old policy\. Both policies provide read\-only access to the OpenSearch Service configuration API \(`es:Describe*`, `es:List*`, and `es:Get*`\) and *no* access to the HTTP methods for the OpenSearch APIs\. For the policy JSON, see the [IAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonOpenSearchServiceReadOnlyAccess)\.  |  7 September 2021  |
